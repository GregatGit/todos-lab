## Todos Lab

You can see it running [here](https://gregatgit.github.io/todos-lab/)

This was practice to quickly set up a todo list with react, hooks and redux.

I then implemented Material-ui into the project.

It now downloads some tasks using firebase. 

For security the db is read only.

When there are no more todos on the list or they are all done the top bar turns red.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
