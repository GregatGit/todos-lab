## Todos Lab


This was practice to quickly set up a todo list with react, hooks and redux.

I then implemented Material-ui into the project.

It now downloads some tasks using firebase. 

The db is read only - just to stop anyone from sending thousands of todos.

When there are no more todos on the list or they are all done the top bar turns green.

You can see it running [here](https://gregatgit.github.io/todos-lab/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
