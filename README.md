## Todos Lab

You can see it running [here](https://gregatgit.github.io/todos-lab/)
This was practice to quickly set up a todo list with react, hooks and redux.

I then implemented Material-ui into the project.

When there are no more todos on the list or they are all done the top bar turns green.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
